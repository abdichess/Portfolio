# Diabetes Prediction Web App

This repository contains a Flask web application that uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health indicators.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting patient data.
- Machine learning model for predicting diabetes diagnosis.
- Displays the prediction result on a separate page.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- joblib
- pandas
- A pre-trained machine learning model (`diabetes_model.pkl`)

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
git clone https://github.com/saturnthehustler/Machine-Model-for-Diabetes-Prediction.git
cd Machine-Model-for-Diabetes-Prediction

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required Python packages.

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask application.

bash
python app.py

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Usage

1. Enter the patient's data into the form on the home page.
2. Submit the form to get the prediction result.

## Model

The machine learning model used in this application is a pre-trained logistic regression model. It was trained on a dataset with various health indicators to predict diabetes. The model's performance is based on the dataset's characteristics and may not be perfect.
