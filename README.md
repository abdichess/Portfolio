# Diabetes Identification & Prediction

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health indicators. The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Blood Glucose (mg/dL)
- HbA1c (%)
- Systolic BP (mmHg)
- Diastolic BP (mmHg)
- Family History of Diabetes
- Physical Activity Level
- Region
- Smoking Status
- Alcohol Consumption
- Fasting Insulin (ÂµU/mL)
- Diabetes Diagnosis (binary target variable)

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

- `model for diabetes identification & predictioned3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `diabetes_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for this project.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. The preprocessing steps include:

1. Loading the dataset.
2. Checking for missing values and zeros in the dataset.
3. Visualizing the distribution of the target variable.
4. Creating histograms for each feature to understand their distributions.
5. Creating a scatter matrix to visualize the relationship between different features.
6. Calculating the correlation matrix to identify feature correlations.
7. Splitting the dataset into features and target variable.
8. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
9. Applying preprocessing steps to the training and testing sets, including imputation of missing values, encoding of categorical variables, and normalization of numerical features.

## Model Training

A logistic regression model is trained using the preprocessed data. The model is then optimized using grid search cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the ROC AUC score and a classification report.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to preprocess a dataset, train a logistic regression model, and optimize its hyperparameters using grid search. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
